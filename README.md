# Attendance-marking-system

The Employee Attendance System is a simple web-based application that allows employees to mark their daily attendance and managers to monitor team attendance. The system includes user registration, login authentication, and role-based dashboards.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and stores data locally in the browser using localStorage. It is designed as a beginner-friendly frontend project and can later be connected to a backend database.
